                    <b>Function (Character set):</b> Emoji character set has to be modified in order to display emoji correctly.
                    Having the up-to-date emoji font installed on your device is not enough, as iOS recognizes and displays
                    emojis based on character set known by it. For an analogy, the character set consists of tickets of all
                    emojis (emoji characters) allowed to be displayed. If a ticket isn't found for an emoji, that emoji won't
                    display properly, instead as "?", "..." or blank space. EmojiAttributes makes sure there is a ticket
                    for everyone.</p>
                <p>
                    <b>Function (Combined characters):</b> Some emojis are made of multiple characters. This has been a thing
                    since iOS 8.3 when Apple introduced family, couple emojis and also skinned emojis. Apple used to treat
                    emoji as one single character (or, one character followed by just a variant selector character: 0xFE0F).
                    Therefore, if the code (in EmojiAttributes) that handles grouped emojis doesn't present, iOS would break
                    them into separate emojis, and not combined as a single unit as it should. Also, being able to see them
                    as one unit means you can delete the whole emoji at once.</p>
