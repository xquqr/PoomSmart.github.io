                <p>This tweak was fully tested on iPhone 4s iOS 9.0.2/9.3.5. Other devices might support, but is not guaranteed.</p>
                <p>This tweak allows you to use Dictation to say words like "Capture", "Cheese" in order to take photos. You
                    can personalize words from settings too. One downside of this tweak is that it will not work with devices
                    with camera using multiple inputs at a time. For instance, iPhone that is compatible with Live Photo
                    will not support. It was supposed to be the first commercial tweak but the developer itself did basically
                    give up developing and just opened source this tweak. Perhaps some talented guys out there would refine
                    it to be something special.</p>
